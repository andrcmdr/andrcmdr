## About me

```
I'm a server-side systems software developer in Rust for GNU/Linux containerized cloud environments.
Currently I'm working in block-chain space.
I gained my knowledge and experience in practice while working in the telecoms, financial technology and banking industries. I've programmed in many languages and continuously used GNU/Linux since 2003, when I was at high school.
Now I programing in Rust, scripting in Bash/Python/Ruby, enjoys using Arch, Gentoo and Debian, contributing and maintaining some AUR packages, focused on building distributed cloud and networking systems, while leading the adoption of DevOps practices in teams.
I have a strong interest in freedom and privacy on the internet, decentralized finances, cryptography, and open source software.
In my spare time, I enjoys hiking and being outdoors among the mountains and lakes of Kyrgyzstan.
